**Introduction**

This Python script allows users to input their height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) to calculate their BMI. Based on the result, the script categorizes the user into various health categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, or clinically obese.

**Usage**

1. Clone or download the project.<br>
2. Run the script using any Python environment or IDE.<br>
3. Follow the on-screen prompts:<br>
   - Enter your height in meters.<br>
   - Enter your weight in kilograms.<br>

The script will then output your BMI and the corresponding weight category.<br><br>

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT**<br>
Enter your height in m: 1.75<br>
Enter your weight in kg: 68<br>
Your BMI is 22.2, you have a normal weight.<br>

**BMI Categories**<br>
The script categorizes BMI results as follows:<br>

Underweight: BMI < 18.5<br>
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25<br>
Slightly overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30<br>
Obese: 30 ≤ BMI < 35<br>
Clinically obese: BMI ≥ 35<br><br>

**Formula**<br>
The formula used to calculate BMI is:<br>

BMI = weight / (height ** 2)<br>


Where:

weight is in kilograms (kg)<br>
height is in meters (m)<br><br><br>

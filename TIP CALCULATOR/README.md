## Introduction

The Tip Calculator is a straightforward Python script designed to help you calculate the per-person share of a bill, including the tip. By inputting the total bill amount, desired tip percentage, and number of people sharing the bill, the script provides an easy way to determine how much each person should pay.

## Features

- Calculates the tip amount based on user-defined percentage.
- Computes the total amount including tip.
- Divides the total amount by the number of people to determine each person’s share.
- Rounds and formats the final amount to two decimal places for accuracy.

## How It Works

1. The script starts by displaying a welcome message to the user.
2. It prompts the user to enter the total bill amount.
3. The user is then asked for the percentage of the tip they would like to give.
4. The script requests the number of people who will split the bill.
5. It calculates the tip amount, adds it to the total bill, and divides the result by the number of people.
